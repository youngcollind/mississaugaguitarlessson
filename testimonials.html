            <div class="testimonial">
                <p>Collin is easily one of the best, if not the best, guitar teachers in the area. I tried lessons from a variety of other local teachers, but found them all lacking in some way whether it be cohesion, consistency, or professionalism. Collin, on the other hand, offers structured lessons which are both consistent and professional. There is a logical sequence to what Collin teaches, and he does an excellent job of mixing exercises with songs, while also incorporating music theory, but at a slow and steady pace which makes it much easier to follow and understand. I highly recommend Collin's lessons to guitar students at any level.</p>

            <div class="testimonial">
                <p>Collin is amazing teacher. My son (15) started Guitar lessons virtually once a week with Collin back in November 2020, before then he really didn't play any musical instruments. Collin method of teaching is really good, he ensures the student learns the basic concept and feels comfortable with the instrument, before jumping into songs. My son never liked music and now he can't put down his guitar. I'm even thinking about Investing in here electric guitar for him. His confident level has gone up and he learn to play his favourite songs. I feel music was a key in my sons development and helped him through the pandemic. I would Highly recommend Collin to anyone who would like to play a guitar. With a great teacher like Collin any could learn to play a guitar.</p>

                <p>Collin is an amazing guitar teacher! He's patient and fun to work with, and I've learned more in 6 months than I learned by myself in more than a year. He tailors the classes to the way you want to learn, be it guitar/music theory or just learning songs, or a mix of both. I'm very happy with the classes and my progress so far, and I'm excited to keep learning.</p>

                <p>Collin has been teaching my son for over a year and I am really happy with the results. My son enjoys playing the guitar thanks to Collin's passion for music, his patience for explaining things in ways that an 8-year-old can easily understand, and for his ability to motivate him to learn "cool songs". I would strongly recommend him to anyone looking for an experienced guitar teacher.</p>

                <p>I'm a 50 year old who decided 2 years ago that I wanted to play the guitar. Collin has been more than accommodating. He is very patient and willing to work around any busy schedule. If you just want to learn a song or learn guitar theory he is more than qualified. I highly recommend Collin to teach anyone at any age.</p>

                <p>Can't say enough good things about Collin - he's been a great teacher these past few months - patient, friendly, and knowledgeable. He can listen to a random song on youtube and figure out the right chords and notes to play it within minutes, then adjust it to your skillset, which is no easy feat. He's also been open minded about the more outlandish requests ("Hey Collin, let's do an acoustic cover of Low by Flo Rida! Doesn't that sound AWESOME?!")</p>

                <p>For a person like me who is way ahead in years and never thought that I would ever play a musical instrument, I couldn't have discovered an Amazing, Positive, Friendly and very Patient Instructor. It is over a year now and I am thoroughly enjoying his sessions. He is a very knowledgeable and Professional individual who is always on time for his sessions. I mention "always on time" because he comes over to my home for my guitar lessons. He makes it a point to go into as much detail as possible so that he covers the very minute details of playing the guitar. He is also very flexible with choosing songs that I enjoy listening to and time, if a need arises. Would highly recommend. Thank you Collin. Wish you the very best.</p>

                <p>Collin is not only a musician, but a magician! There are teachers and then there are great teachers - Collin has the "IT" factor. I tried a school before him, along with my 6 year old son, and nothing compares to Collin's patient yet effective teaching style. We have only been with him for about under 2 months, but my 6 year is already rocking out to the likes of Weezer. As for myself, I'm now playing songs from start to finish by John Mayer, Nirvana, AC/DC etc. I am a beginner by the way. He has also mastered the way of teaching over zoom! Highly recommend for all ages!</p>

                <p>Collin has been my guitar teacher for about 5 yrs now. In person and over Skype (due to COVID) he's always patient, flexible and on time. His ability to learn song requests in 2 mins and adjust them to my skill level over the yrs never ceases to amaze me. His style of teaching applies no pressure or expectations leaving space to genuinely enjoy guitar and discover how you like to play. :)</p>

                <p>My 12-year-old son has been taking lessons with Collin for 3 years. Collin is very patient when the new skills are tough to master, and in the end we always end up with a happy kid who has learned a new song. He offers a great mix of theory and popular music, and has even taught our son how to improvise. I love that Collin has songs from the 60's to the present, so my son has played The Beatles and The Eagles right on up to Taylor Swift and Imagine Dragons. All that variety keeps my son, who for most part only thinks about sports, interested in music. Two thumbs up for Collin!</p>
